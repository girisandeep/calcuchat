# CalcuChat

A simple calculator with chat-like UI.

The app is available in Google Playstore: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudxlab.calcuchat

I am open sourcing it so that people can learn how to write an (expression parser) [https://github.com/girisandeep/calcuchat/blob/master/lib/calc.dart] and create a chat-like mobile app using flutter.

Feel free to contribute to it.
